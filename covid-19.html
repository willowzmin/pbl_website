                    <h3>About COVID_19</h3>
                    <p>In early 2021, the People's Republic of China and the World Health Organization conducted a joint study that suggested that the virus likely originated from a coronavirus found in wild bats and may have been spread to humans through an intermediary host. Numerous theories have been proposed concerning the source of infection, with ongoing investigations into its origin. Science published several articles in July 2022 that pointed to two spillover events in November 2019 being responsible for the transmission of the virus to humans; these events were thought to be linked to live wildlife trade in Wuhan's Huanan wet market (Hubei, China).

                    <h2>Signs</h2>
                    <p>The signs and symptoms of COVID-19 can vary depending on the particular strain contracted, ranging from no visible effects to a fatal illness. Typical symptoms include coughing, fever, anosmia (loss of smell), and ageusia (loss of taste), with some less common symptoms including headaches, nasal congestion and runny nose, muscle ache, sore throat, diarrhea, eye irritation, and toes swelling or turning purple along with difficulty breathing in moderate to severe cases. Individuals infected with COVID-19 may experience different symptoms which can also evolve. Three customary clusters of signs have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster comprising of coughs, sputum production, shortness of breath, and fever; one musculoskeletal symptom cluster featuring joint and muscle pain as well as headache and fatigue; and a cluster relating to digestion accompanied by abdominal pain, vomiting or d. A loss of taste combined with anosmia is among the most frequently observed symptom associated with COVID-19 infection in those without any previous ear/nose/throat ailments being reported in up to 88% of symptomatic cases.
