                <h1>About SARS</h1>
                <p>SARS was first reported in Asia in February 2003. In early March 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert about SARS. Over the next few months, the illness spread to more than two dozen North America, South America, Europe, and Asia countries. By late July, however, no new cases were being reported and the illness was considered contained. According to WHO, more than 8,000 people worldwide became ill with SARS during this outbreak; of these, 813 died. The United States had eight laboratory-confirmed cases. Illinois had no laboratory-confirmed cases during the outbreak. SARS cases reported in the United States occurred primarily among people who traveled to SARS-affected areas; a small number of other people became ill after being in close contact with a SARS patient while in the United States. There was no evidence that SARS spread more widely in the community in the United States.</p>
