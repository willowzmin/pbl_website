                    <h3>About diseases</h3>
                    <p>An epidemic of meningococcal disease in Geneva was first clinically characterized in 1805 by Gaspard Vieusseux, a general practitioner. The first outbreak in Africa was recorded in the 1840s, but it wasn’t until 1887 that Austrian bacteriologist Anton Vaykselbaum identified meningococcal bacteria as a cause of meningitis.
                        In 1890, Heinrich Quincke (1842–1922) used a procedure called lumbar puncture (LP) on a patient with suspected meningitis. Even today, LP remains the only way to accurately confirm a case of meningitis and reveal its cause.
                        In 1906, scientists began to recommend anti-meningococcal serum therapy to protect humans against meningococcal disease; a therapy based on antibodies initially derived from the blood of horses, and later from patients, or individuals recovering from meningococcal disease. Its effectiveness meant that it was used prophylactically in those who had been in close contact with patients of meningococcal disease – though it was a risky procedure. However, once it was realized that people could carry meningococcal bacteria without showing any clinical signs of disease, efforts were focused on eliminating this carrier status. Attempts at spraying dried anti-meningococcal serum into the nostrils however produced disappointing results.</p>

                    <h2>How To protect</h2>
                    <p>Just as with cold and flu viruses, the viruses and bacteria responsible for meningitis can get on your hands and into your mouth. You can prevent meningitis from spreading by washing your hands vigorously, especially after you use the bathroom, change a diaper, spend time in a crowded place, and cough or blow your nose. Use hot, soapy water and be sure to get both the fronts and backs of your hands and each finger. Rub your hands together for a full 20 seconds then rinse and dry them with a clean towel. "Hand sanitizers are fine, too.<p>

                           <li>Fever</li>

                           <li>Vomiting</li>
                           <li>Photophobia</li>

                        <p>Newborns and babies may not have the classic symptoms listed above, or it may be difficult to notice those symptoms in babies. Instead, babies may be slow or inactive, irritable, vomiting, feeding poorly, or have a bulging anterior fontanelle (the soft spot of the skull). In young children, doctors may also look at the child’s reflexes for signs of meningitis.</p>
