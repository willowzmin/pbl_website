                    <p>The virus that causes human immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) is a disease that focuses on the immune system, primarily white blood cells known as CD4 cells. HIV destroys the white blood cells, reducing an individual's immunity to opportunities for infection. There is no effective cure currently. Once people get HIV, they have it for life. People who have/get HIV should get effective and comprehensive Prevention, curing and testing not to get any serious infections like cryptococcal, tuberculosis and lymphomas as well as serious infections caused by bacteria and multiple malignancies., which can cause the person to die. But to reduce the risk from any serious infections the infected person needs to take a pill called ART.ART should be taken every day throughout the person’s life.</p>

                    <h2>SIGNS</h2>
                    <p>If a person gets HIV/AIDS, for the first months that person don’t know they are infected, they  do not feel symptoms. And those months are the period of the virus is most infectious. Over time, the symptoms will become more obvious, Swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea, and cough are some of the symptoms. HIV reduces the body's capacity to fight other infections, and those who do not receive treatment are more vulnerable to other serious diseases.</p>
