                <h1>About Measles</h1>
                <p>In the 9th century, a Persian doctor published one of the earliest written accounts regarding measles. In 1757, Francis Home, a Scottish physician, established that the infectious agent in the blood of those affected was responsible for the disease. By 1912, reporting all diagnosed cases was mandatory in the United States; each year around 6,000 related deaths were reported. Prior to 91 1963 when vaccination became available, nearly all children had contracted measles by age 15. It's estimated that 3 to 4 million were infected on an annual basis; during this pe, 400-500 people perished, 48,000 were hospitalized and 1,000 experienced encephalitis from measles complications.</p>
